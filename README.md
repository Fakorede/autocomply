# AutoComply Introduction

> AutoComply is the static analysis tool we introduce in our paper "Understanding and Detecting Platform-Specific Violations in Android Auto Apps".


We introduce `AutoComply`, a static analysis framework that detects compliance violations in Android Auto apps. `AutoComply` constructs Car-Control Flow Graph (CCFG) to capture interactions between app components, and platform-specific callbacks. It applies specialized checkers to detect UI violations, media playback errors, and issues with voice command handling.
We evaluated `AutoComply` on a dataset of 31 Android Auto apps and detected 27 new issues, 14 of which have been confirmed by developers, and 8 of the confirmed issues have already been fixed. 
The results show that `AutoComply` helps developers identify and fix compliance violation issues, improving the in-vehicle experience.

This artifact contains the [apks](#application-resources), [python scripts](#python-scripts) we used to retrieve apks and repos with android auto support from F-Droid and GitHub for our study and evaluation, the [dataset](#data-files) of apps,  and also a binary of AutoComply. It also contains [reports](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/autocomply/RQs/RQ3/CorpusG%20-%20Detailed%20Analysis%20Report/) generated by AutoComply for each of these apks in [Corpus-G](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/autocomply/RQs/RQ3/Corpus-G.csv).


## Artifacts

### Python Scripts
- [fdroid_crawler.py](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/autocomply/fdroid_crawler.py) - Python script we used for collecting Free and Open Source Software android APKs from [f-droid](https://f-droid.org/en/). Running this script required downloading the Selenium ChromeDriver.
- [helpers.py](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/autocomply/fdroid_crawler.py) - Utility script for functions we used in the `fdroid_crawler.py` script.
- [github_code_search.py](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/autocomply/github_code_search.py) - Python script we used for searching GitHub repositories for android auto patterns. 
- [github_repo_details.py](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/autocomply/github_repo_details.py) - Python script we used for extracting detailed metadata from the GitHub repositories we retrieved.
- [car_feat.py](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/autocomply/car_feat.py) - Python binary analysis tool used to perform Android Auto specific feature checks.

### Data Files
- [FDroid Apps](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/autocomply/RQs/RQ1/Corpus-L.csv) - dataset of 4,387 apps used in our formative study.
- [Corpus-F](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/autocomply/RQs/RQ2/Corpus-R.csv) - dataset of 37 apps used in our formative study.
- [Corpus-G](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/autocomply/RQs/RQ3/Corpus-G.csv) - dataset of 31 apps used in our evaluation of AutoComply.

### Application Resources
- [apks](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/autocomply/apks) - directory containing the apks in *Corpus-G* used for compatibility testing and analysis.
- [carcompat-0.3.0.jar](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/autocomply/AutoComply-0.3.0.jar) - our tool for android auto compatibility testing.

### Research Output
- [RQs](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/autocomply/RQs/) - directory containing evaluation results organized by research questions. Includes statistical analysis, test outputs, and performance metrics used to validate project hypotheses.

## Requirements

- Java 17
- Python 3

## Download

To run the analysis using the binary, you need to have Java 17 and Python3 installed. Then follow the instructions

1. Git clone the GitHub repo or Download the repository from [here](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/autocomply).

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the root of the project.

3. Ensure you follow the setup instructions provided below before running the analysis. You must:
- clone the `android-platforms` in the root of the project
- run the `setup.sh` script

4. Download the archived apks from [here](https://archive.org/download/apks_20250315), unzip and place them in the `/apks` folder.

## Setup Instructions

```shell
$ cd autocomply
$ git clone https://github.com/Sable/android-platforms
$ chmod +x setup.sh
$ ./setup.sh # Install python dependencies
```

## Run

All apks used for the evaluation section of our paper should be downloaded from the [link](https://archive.org/download/apks_20250315) and placed [here](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/autocomply/apks/).

```shell
