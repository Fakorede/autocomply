# RQ 1: Landscape 

> Which apps are attempting to incorporate Android Auto features? What are the common categories?

We collected all available apps from F-Droid, resulting in a [dataset](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/carcompat-0503/RQs/RQ1/Corpus-L.csv) of 4,387
Android apps, which we refer to as [Corpus-L](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/carcompat-0503/RQs/RQ1/Corpus-L.csv).

### Category distribution of Android Auto Apps discovered in *Corpus-L*

| Categories | Description | # of apps |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Media | Allows users to access audio content like music, radio, and audiobooks. | 23 (52.3%) |
| Messaging | Enables message notifications, text-to-speech, and voice-activated replies. | 18 (40.9%) |
| Navigation | Offer turn-by-turn navigation to guide drivers to their destinations. | 2 (4.5%) |
| POI | Apps for discovering and navigating to points of interest, including parking. | 1 (2.3%) |


## Answer

Out of 4,387 apps in Corpus-L, only 44 apps
were found that support Android Auto. As expected, the majority
of these apps belong to the media category, reflecting the dominant
role that car infotainment systems play in media consumption. The
messaging apps account for 40.9% of the total, which are useful for
the communication needs during driving. In contrast, navigation
and POI apps are the least represented categories, indicating a
limited development focus in these areas.
